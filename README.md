# ImageClassificationNetwork

Our code trains a neural network with convolutional layers and feed forward layers. After this, the code takes the trained network and extracts
features after the convolutional step, and brings them into a Random Forest model. The testing accuracy of both the regular feed forward and 
Random Forest are very similar, both hovering around 60%
